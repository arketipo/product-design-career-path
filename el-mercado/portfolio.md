I found a trick to make portfolio creation 10x easier.

Before you _design_ your portfolio, _write_ your portfolio.

I know it’s tempting to jump straight into the design tool.

But hang on for a moment…and consider these 3 steps:

1/ Create your outline

* Open a text document
* Type a list of each page you will include
* Under each page, type each section
* On your “projects” page, list each project

Bam, at this point you have the full outline.

It’s better to be here right now with text.

If you arrive here first in the design tool you’ll stress too much over pixels.

Now it’s easy to decide if this is the right direction before committing.

2/ Get inspired by other designers

* Find 3 portfolios you admire
* Scroll through their site
* Write a list of the pages/sections they include
* See if they do anything you love that inspires yours

Congrats, now you enhanced your structure without moving a single design pixel.

3/ Add the meat

* Type out the content you wish to include under each page/section
* This may include your positioning statement, bio, project overviews, visuals to include, etc.

Super, now you’ve just given yourself a blueprint for your entire portfolio.

The key is to write with words what you hope to see with your eyes.

If you jump into the tool first, you’ll get overwhelmed with decisions.

By writing your portfolio first you made 100+ decisions while the structure was more malleable.

It’s easier to edit words than it is to edit polished pixels.

Way to go, you are amazing.
